Ticketee

Rails4 in Action guides you through creating this app, continually adding new features and complexity. 
The book uses BDD, so RSpec tests are created before each feature is developed. The app provides the ability to CRUD projects, which has_many tickets. Users can sign up and sign in, and admins can be created. Fine grained permissions allow users to view and edit only those projects and tickets they have access to. When creating tickets, files can be attached to the ticket.
